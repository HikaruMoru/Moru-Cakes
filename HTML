        <p>STEP 1
Heat the oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5. Cream the butter in a large bowl with a wooden spoon or in a stand mixer until it is soft. Add the sugar and keep beating until the mixture is light and fluffy. Sift in the flour and add the optional ingredients, if you’re using them. Bring the mixture together with your hands in a figure-of-eight motion until it forms a dough. You can freeze the dough at this point.
</p>
<p> STEP 2
Roll the dough into walnut-sized balls and place them slightly apart from each other on a baking sheet (you don’t need to butter or line it). Flatten the balls a little with the palm of your hand and bake them in the oven for around 10-12 mins until they are golden brown and slightly firm on top. Leave the cookies on a cooling rack for around 15 mins before serving.</p>

        <p>A simple vanilla cake recipe is the perfect introductory cake for beginners, as well as a versatile standby for more experienced bakers to have on hand. While there’s a whole, huge, hypercalorific world of complicated cakes out there to explore, from red velvet cakes to lemon drizzle cakes, this easy cake recipe is where it all begins and it's worth mastering so you can get the basics of cake making under your belt before you start to jazz it up with flavour additions and decorating finesse.
        
        A simple vanilla cake recipe does what it says on the tin: provides you with a delicate, moist and flavourful cake that can serve as a base for something more elaborate, please a host of children clamouring for something sweet or provide a simple sugar fix. This is a cake recipe that works splendidly for birthdays, special occasions, or just that celebrated English ceremony, afternoon tea. We also believe that you never need a reason to make or eat a simple vanilla cake, so have it whenever the urge to bake takes you. It’s the most basic possible combination of eggs, flour, butter and sugar – practically the Platonic ideal of a cake – baked in the oven for 45-50 minutes. You’ll know it’s done when it’s golden on top, and a skewer inserted into its side comes out clean.
        
        Once the cake has cooled, slather it with buttercream frosting, pile fruit on top of it, or simply dust it with icing sugar, and it’ll be delightful any way you choose to slice it. You could even turn it into a Victoria sponge by cutting it in half laterally once cool, adding a layer of jam and sticking it back together again – though we also have a very good Victoria sponge recipe to follow for more specific instructions.
        
        If you’re looking for something a little more challenging, we have all sorts of cake recipes to try: we recommend moving on to our easy chocolate cake if you’re a fan of this cake, or chocolate fairy cakes make a nice treat and are fun for kids to make.</p>

           <h1> Tips</h1>
            <p>If you fantasise about being a star baker but find the whole process a little intimidating, this is the perfect easy cake for you. It’s infinitely variable and incredibly simple to make. Simply place all the ingredients in a bowl and beat until combined. You can mix with a wooden spoon, a hand-held electric mixer or by using the pulse action of a food processor, for varying levels of manual difficulty.
            Using margarine rather than butter works really well for this cake and saves you the bother and time of having to soften the butter before you start.
            Don’t be tempted to open the oven before 40 minutes – you’ll regret it.
            Once the cake has cooled, put it in an airtight container and it can be stored for up to two days.</p>

          <p>The more cake baking experience I have, the more often I reach for cake flour instead of all-purpose flour. You see, cake flour is a low protein flour that’s finely milled into a delicate consistency. This soft, tender texture directly translates into your baked cake. However, some recipes simply cannot withstand fine cake flour. Chocolate cake, for example, already has cocoa powder– which is a VERY fine dry ingredient. In my experience, the combination of cake flour and cocoa powder results in a flimsy chocolate cake. Likewise, spice cake, carrot cake, hummingbird cake, and banana cake contain additional wet ingredients (the fruits or veggies), so cake flour usually isn’t ideal.</p>
